      <b><i> Abstract: </i></b> Informal taxation, whereby households contribute to public goods outside the formal tax system, plays an important role in local public good financing in many low-income countries, yet little is known about its magnitude or incidence. Informal taxation is implemented by local leaders and trades off information advantages with potential elite capture and reduced enforcement. In contrast to formal tax systems, it is unclear how household informal tax payments respond to changes in income. This paper uses panel data on households and local leaders, combined with exogenous variation in household income from a large-scale randomized controlled trial of a one-time unconditional cash transfer to poor households, to study how informal taxation and public goods provision responds to household income shocks. The (temporary) cash transfers are not captured by local leaders: I find no effect on household informal tax payments, and recipient household payments are in line with their pre-treatment income. In contrast, informal taxes do respond to non-experimental changes in permanent income in panel data. Recipient households pay more formal self-employment taxes, though the magnitude of the increase is small relative to the transfer amount: less than 1 percent of total transfer income is captured by formal or informal taxes. I find no effects of the cash transfers on public goods provision. This suggests local leaders emphasize equity considerations by exempting cash transfers to poor households, but miss out on opportunity to meaningfully increase public goods investment.

      <b><i> Abstract: </i></b> How does a short-term spike in income from a cash transfer from a foreign NGO affect interactions between local politicians and households, both recipient and non-recipient? We have randomly allocated the roll-out of GiveDirectly’s unconditional cash transfer programme in two trials across 1,069 villages in Western Kenya. We test whether, as our qualitative work suggests, recipient households that receive a positive income shock make fewer requests for financial assistance from local politicians. We also explore the governance implications by investigating households’ political attitudes and changes in participation of communities in consultations about local public goods. Finally, we examine the effect of cash transfers on the behaviour of politicians: we expect them to only claim limited credit for the transfers, and will test whether they change their amount of private assistance to recipient and non-recipient households.

          <p> Abstract: The repo market has been viewed as a potential source of financial instability since the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, based in part on findings that margins increased sharply in a segment of this market. This paper provides evidence suggesting that there was no system-wide run on repo. Using confidential data on tri-party repo, a major segment of this market, we show that, the level of margins and the amount of funding were surprisingly stable for most borrowers during the crisis. However, we also document a sharp decline in the tri-party repo funding of Lehman in September 2008. </p>
