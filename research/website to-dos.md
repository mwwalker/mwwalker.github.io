website to-dos:
 - figure out how to highlight KLPS and GE work a little more -- want these publications to stand out
 - add in PLOS and SPA papers to publications
 - update work in progress / working papers to reflect complementarities paper, storybooks, other items that are being actively worked on / presented. (highlight presentations?)
 - update picture with one from CEGA
 - consider altering the overall structure?
