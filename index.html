                <p class="lead"> <p>I am a currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Berkeley's <a href="https://cega.berkeley.edu"> Center for Effective Global Action</a>.

                My research interests are development economics and public economics.

                My <a href="http://www.michaelwwalker.me/research/"> research</a> primarily consists of field experiments in Kenya. Current projects include studies of the effects of cash transfers on a broad range of outcomes, including public goods, and on the long-term effects of child health interventions.</p>
