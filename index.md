	### About Me

	I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley. My research interests are development economics, public economics and applied microeconomics.

    ** I am on the 2017/18 job market and will be available for interviews at the ASSA meetings in Philadelphia **

    Prior to starting graduate school, I was an Assistant Economist in Research Group of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
